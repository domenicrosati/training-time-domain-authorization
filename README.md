- `notebooks` contains jupyter notebooks
- `scripts` scripts used for analysis and other tasks
- `training_time_domain_authorization` contains the source code for the project
- `results` contains the results of the experiments
- `models` contains the trained models
- `experiments` contains the scripts to run the experiments
- `training_time_domain_authorization/datasets` - contains data loaders and evaluations for each dataset
